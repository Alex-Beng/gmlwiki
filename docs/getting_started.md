# What is the Godot Mod Loader?
GML is a generalized mod loader for GDScript-based Godot games.
The mod loader allows users to create mods for games and distribute them as zips.

Importantly, it provides methods to change existing scripts, scenes, and resources without modifying and distributing vanilla game files.

!> Please note that GML does not condone the use of malicious mods. e.g. mods that allow for cheating in online games, among other things.

## Mod Developer

3. [Set up]() your Godot project for modding
4. Create your [Mod Structure]()
5. Create your [Mod Files]()
6. Use the [API Methods]()

## Mod user
