# Contributing to Our Documentation
Hey there! ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for thinking about contributing to the [Godot Mod Loader](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader) documentation. 

Most of this documentation is written using basic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 
Updating the documentation is as simple as modifying one of the files and opening a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) - 
or even just sending us the file on our [Discord](https://discord.godotmodding.com/).

If you want to go more in-depth and preview your changes better, here's a quick guide to get you started.

## Setup

1. Install [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) on your system.
2. Fork and clone this repository: [GitHub Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
3. **(Optional, but recommended)** Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```shell
   python -m venv .
   source bin/activate  # On Windows use: .\Scripts\activate
   ```
5. Install requirements:
   ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. Start MkDocs: 
    ```shell
    mkdocs serve
    ```
7. Open the local docs in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

To keep things organized please continue reading!

## Doc Structure
All documentation needs to be in the `docs/` directory, files outside of it are ignored.

### Subdirectories
- `api/` - Contains the Godot Mod Loader api documentation. Automatically generated - if you spot any problems please open an [issue](https://github.com/GodotModding/gmlwiki/issues) or [contact us](https://discord.godotmodding.com/).
- `guides/` - Contains guides to use specific mod loader features. The sub folders logically separate guides for modders and for game developers aiming to integrate the mod loader.
- `misc/` - Contains pages that don't fit the first categories. If you find something that doesn't belong anywhere, create a folder where it does. Be sure to make this known in your PR.
- `_media/` - A folder included wherever media (png, mp3, mp4, etc...) is used. If your media is only used inside one directory please use a directory specific `_media/` folder.

## New Pages
Make sure the name of your file is in snake_case.

After adding a new page, make sure to include it in the sidebar navigation by adding it to [`mkdocs.yml`](./mkdocs.yml)

## Editing Tips

MkDocs [requires links to other doc pages](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#internal-links) 
to always be relative and to link to a `.md` file. If you use the link from the browser's 
url bar - `[Script Hooks](/guides/modding/script_hooks/)`, you will get an error:
```
Doc file 'guides/modding/script_extensions.md' contains an absolute link '/guides/modding/script_hooks/', it was left as is. Did you mean 'script_hooks.md'?
```
The correct way to link here is: `[Script Hooks](script_hooks.md)`.   
Since those are relative file paths, linking to another folder looks like this `[API Reference](../../api/mod_loader_mod.md)`   
Linking to headers is possible too by adding the part after `#` from the browser url at the end `mod_loader_mod.md#method-install_script_extension`

The documentation uses [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
which allows us to use extended Markdown. Installed extensions can be found at the end of [`mkdocs.yml`](./mkdocs.yml)

Here are a few commonly used features from the extended markdown:

To create special notes or warnings, use [Admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/).

To add information on hover, use [Tooltips](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/tooltips/#usage) or 
add the specific word to [abbreviations.md](includes/abbreviations.md) 

[Code Blocks](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/) and 
[Content Tabs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/content-tabs/) 
together allow us to have highlighted code examples for Godot 3 and 4 with an easy toggle. 
The tab names need to be consistent across all pages to enable tab state synchronisation.

You can simply copy this snippet for that purpose.
```markdown
=== "Godot 4"

    ```gdscript
    [...]
    ```

=== "Godot 3"

    ```gdscript
    [...]
    ```
```

Code blocks can also highlight single or a range of lines by adding this   
`gdscript hl_lines="1 2-5"`

For codeblocks to use proper highlighting, always add the language at the top, usually `gdscript`, as seen above.

Inline code [can also be highlighted](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/#highlighting-inline-code-blocks)
by adding `#!` followed by the language - `#!gd print("hello world")`

While both `gdscript` and `gd` work, the former is preferred for code blocks to be explicit while the latter
is preferred for inline highlights to remain brief.

## API Docs generation

Replace "godot4.3" with the path to your editor exe, or alias it. 

From the project directory, run

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule sync
git submodule update --remote
cd godot-mod-loader
godot4.3 --doctool ../gdscript_docs --gdscript-docs res://addons/mod_loader/api/ --quit
cd ..
python3 xml_to_md.py
```

The path set with `--gdscript-docs` needs to start with `res://`, otherwise godot can't find the files.   
[workaround credit](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/84579#issuecomment-1873346477)

And for some reason the docs gen only works correctly from the godot project root, so we change directory into
the submodule and out after we're done, otherwise we get a bunch of parse errors.

## Syntax highlights

Code syntax highlights are taken from the Godot editor for both the light and dark themes.
Since the pygments lexer is severely outdated for gdscript, some colors sadly
don't properly apply.

We used this small script to get the colors from the current editor theme and match
them to the css variables or classes used by mkdocs material.

```gdscript
@tool
extends Node

@export var run_now := false:
	set(val):
		run()


func run():
	var prefix := "text_editor/theme/highlighting/"
	var colors := {
		"symbol_color": ["--md-code-hl-operator-color", "--md-code-hl-punctuation-color"],
		"keyword_color": ["--md-code-hl-keyword-color", "--md-code-hl-special-color"],
		"control_flow_keyword_color": [],
		"base_type_color": [".nb.nb-Type"],
		"engine_type_color": [],
		"user_type_color": [],
		"comment_color": ["--md-code-hl-comment-color"],

		"completion_background_color": [],

		"selection_color": [],
		"brace_mismatch_color": [],
		"current_line_color": [],

		"word_highlighted_color": ["--md-code-hl-color"],

		"function_color": ["--md-code-hl-function-color"],
		"member_variable_color": ["--md-code-hl-variable-color", "--md-code-hl-constant-color"],
		"mark_color": [],
		"breakpoint_color": [],
		"code_folding_color": [],
		"search_result_color": [],
	}

	var settings := EditorInterface.get_editor_settings()

	var color_classes := ""
	print("{")
	print("\t--godot-theme-base-color: #%s;\n" % settings.get("interface/theme/base_color").to_html(true))
	for color_name in colors:
		var color: Color = settings.get(prefix + color_name)
		for css_thing: String in colors[color_name]:
			if css_thing.begins_with("--"):
				print("\t%s: #%s;" % [css_thing, color.to_html(true)])
			elif css_thing.begins_with("."):
				var css_var := "--md-code-hl-custom-class%s" % css_thing.replace(".", "_")
				print("\t%s: #%s;" % [css_var, color.to_html(true)])
				color_classes += "\n.highlight %s {\n\tcolor: var(%s);\n}\n" % [css_thing, css_var]
	print("}")
	print(color_classes)
```
