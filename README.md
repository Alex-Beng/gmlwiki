# Godot Mod Loader Wiki
The official [Godot Mod Loader](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader) documentation website

## Why?
This project aims to improve the documentation for the Godot Mod Loader, replacing the previous GitHub wiki.

## Contributing
*Just about* all of the documentation is Markdown files. It's as simple as modifing one of these files and opening a PR.   
If you'd like to self host this documentation please install [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) and run `docsify serve docs/`.
