The unofficial [Godot Mod Loader](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader) documentation website

## Why?
I love the Godot Mod Loader, but it's documentation is a bit lacking. This project aims to improve and maintain the documentation for the Godot Mod Loader. With the hope of dropping "unofficial" from this README

## Contributing
*Just about* all of the documentation is Markdown files. It's as simple as modifing one of these files and opening a PR. If you'd like to self host this documentation please install [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) and run `docsify serve docs/`.
